## Personal project for analysis and lineup generator
Before I learned how to use R, I tried my hand at Python data analysis. This was my first attempt at using the tools to gain
insight into the NFL and fantasy football. My goal was to use betting data and betting lines to help predict fantasy points.
My first run at data analysis didn't work out too well. However I did build a showdown lineup optimizer for Draftkings that I
still use every year. I will be working on improving my data analysis using R in the future.

The betting data analysis is all contained in one file, as this was before I learned too much programming. And the lineup generator is another file.
